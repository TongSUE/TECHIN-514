## COLLABORATION BONUS
### Helping another student
- Name of the student I helped: Lucia Shen
- What I helped her with: I helped Lucia design and troubleshoot the LED and switch circuit. We worked through the wiring together and discovered that the circuit did not work at first because some rows on the breadboard were not properly connected. After moving the components to different slots, the circuit functioned correctly.
